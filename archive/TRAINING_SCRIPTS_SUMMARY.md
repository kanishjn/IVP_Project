# Training Scripts Summary

## Overview
We've reorganized the SVM training workflow with proper train/test splits and created two parallel tracks:

### 1. **Root Directory** - Balanced Dataset Training
Located in `/Applications/my_work/IVP/`

#### Files Created:

**`train_model.py`** - Main training script
- Loads full dataset (1000 images)
- **Balances classes** by undersampling to minority class (222 samples per class)
- Total: 666 balanced samples
- Applies feature engineering (35 → 61 features)
- **Splits into 80/20 train/test** (stratified)
- Trains SVM with best known parameters (C=10, gamma=0.05, RBF kernel, 50 features)
- Evaluates on test set
- Saves: `balanced_svm_model.joblib` and `balanced_svm_confusion_matrix.png`

**`svm_optimizer.py`** - Hyperparameter optimization
- Same data loading and balancing as `train_model.py`
- **Splits into 80/20 train/test** before optimization
- Performs GridSearchCV on **training set only** (prevents data leakage)
- Tests multiple kernels, C values, gamma values, and feature counts
- Evaluates best model on **test set**
- Supports `--quick` flag for faster optimization
- Saves: `optimized_svm_model.joblib`

### 2. **iteration_1/** - Full Dataset Training
Located in `/Applications/my_work/IVP/iteration_1/`

#### Files Created:

**`train_full_dataset.py`** - Train on ALL data (no balancing)
- Uses all 1000 images (507 GALAXY, 271 QSO, 222 STAR)
- Applies feature engineering
- **Splits into 80/20 train/test** (stratified)
- Uses `class_weight='balanced'` to handle imbalance
- Performs GridSearchCV on training set
- Evaluates on test set
- Saves: `full_dataset_svm_model.joblib`, confusion matrix, training report

**`evaluate_full_dataset.py`** - Comprehensive evaluation ✅ **FIXED**
- Loads the trained model
- Loads full dataset
- Applies same feature engineering
- **NOW PROPERLY SPLITS DATA** into train/test (80/20, same random_state=42)
- Evaluates on **TEST SET ONLY** (prevents overfitting metrics)
- Performs cross-validation on full dataset for comparison
- Generates visualizations and detailed reports
- Saves: evaluation plots and comprehensive report

## Key Improvements Made

### ✅ Proper Train/Test Split
All scripts now:
1. Load and prepare data
2. **Split into train (80%) and test (20%)** with stratification
3. Train/optimize on training set only
4. Evaluate final model on test set
5. Use same `random_state=42` for reproducibility

### ✅ No Data Leakage
- Feature engineering applied to full dataset first, then split
- GridSearchCV uses only training data
- Test set never seen during training/optimization
- Cross-validation done on training set during optimization

### ✅ Fixed evaluate_full_dataset.py
Previous issues:
- ❌ Evaluated on full dataset (no train/test split)
- ❌ Could show inflated metrics

Now fixed:
- ✅ Splits data same as training (random_state=42)
- ✅ Evaluates only on test set
- ✅ Cross-validation on full dataset for reference
- ✅ Clear labeling of which metrics are from which set

## Usage

### Quick Start - Train Balanced Model
```bash
cd /Applications/my_work/IVP
python train_model.py
```

### Optimize Hyperparameters
```bash
# Quick optimization (faster)
python svm_optimizer.py --quick

# Full optimization (slower, more thorough)
python svm_optimizer.py
```

### Train on Full Dataset (Iteration 1)
```bash
cd iteration_1
python train_full_dataset.py
python evaluate_full_dataset.py
```

## Expected Outputs

### Root Directory (Balanced)
- `balanced_svm_model.joblib` - Trained model
- `balanced_svm_confusion_matrix.png` - Visualization
- Expected performance: ~62-66% accuracy, balanced across classes

### iteration_1/ (Full Dataset)
- `full_dataset_svm_model.joblib` - Trained model
- `full_dataset_confusion_matrix.png` - Training confusion matrix
- `full_dataset_training_report.txt` - Detailed training metrics
- `full_dataset_confusion_matrix_eval.png` - Test set evaluation
- `full_dataset_class_distribution.png` - Class distribution comparison
- `full_dataset_per_class_metrics.png` - Per-class performance
- `full_dataset_evaluation_report.txt` - Comprehensive evaluation
- Expected performance: Higher overall accuracy but may show galaxy bias

## Data Split Consistency

All scripts use:
- `test_size=0.2` (80/20 split)
- `random_state=42` (reproducible splits)
- `stratify=y` (maintains class proportions in both sets)

This ensures:
1. Fair comparison between models
2. Reproducible results
3. Same test samples across different runs
4. Proper class balance in train/test sets

## Recommendations

1. **For balanced performance across all classes**: Use `train_model.py`
2. **For maximum overall accuracy**: Use `iteration_1/train_full_dataset.py`
3. **For finding best hyperparameters**: Use `svm_optimizer.py`
4. **For comprehensive analysis**: Run both approaches and compare

## Notes

- All scripts save their outputs in their respective directories
- Training times vary: balanced (~2-5 min), full dataset (~10-20 min), optimizer (~30-60 min)
- GPU acceleration not used (scikit-learn SVM uses CPU)
- Random state fixed for reproducibility across all scripts
