## üìä Techniques Applied

### ‚úÖ What Worked Well

#### 1. **Data Augmentation (+4.39%)**
- Added 30% synthetic samples through Gaussian noise perturbation
- Increased training data from 666 ‚Üí 865 samples
- **Impact: HIGH** - Best single improvement

#### 2. **Advanced Feature Engineering**
- Original: 35 features
- Engineered: 80 features (+45 new features)
- Added:
  - Statistical moments (skewness, kurtosis)
  - Intensity ratios and transformations
  - Morphological combinations
  - Radial profile statistics (median, IQR, CV)
  - LBP texture energy
  - Interaction features
- **Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

#### 3. **Ensemble Voting (3 SVMs)**
- Multiple SVM classifiers with different hyperparameters
- Soft voting for probability-based predictions
- Different scalers (RobustScaler, StandardScaler)
- Different feature selection (k=55, 60, 65, 70)
- **Impact: MEDIUM** - Added robustness

#### 4. **RobustScaler**
- Better handling of outliers vs StandardScaler
- More stable normalization for astronomical data
- **Impact: MEDIUM**

#### 5. **Variance Threshold Filtering**
- Removed low-variance (noisy) features
- Threshold: 0.01
- **Impact: LOW-MEDIUM**

#### 6. **Balanced Dataset**
- Undersampling to minority class (222 per class)
- Prevents model bias toward majority class
- **Impact: ESSENTIAL**

### ‚ùå What Didn't Work

#### 1. **SMOTE Oversampling**
- Decreased performance (55.97% accuracy)
- Created too many synthetic boundaries
- Caused overfitting
- **Impact: NEGATIVE**

#### 2. **Stacking Ensemble**
- Complex meta-learner approach
- Overfitted to training data
- Too many layers of abstraction
- **Impact: NEGATIVE**

#### 3. **Too Many Features**
- 90+ features led to curse of dimensionality
- Grid search found optimal k=55 (not max 75)
- **Impact: NEUTRAL/NEGATIVE**

## üîß Best Configuration Found

### Optimal Hyperparameters (Grid Search)
```
Kernel: RBF
C: 10
Gamma: 0.08
Features selected: 55 (out of 80 engineered)

## üìà Per-Class Performance (Best Model)

### Baseline vs Improved
| Class | Baseline Acc | Improved Acc | Gain |
|-------|-------------|--------------|------|
| GALAXY | 50.0% | **59.3%** | +9.3% ‚≠ê |
| QSO | 62.2% | **57.9%** | -4.3% |
| STAR | 60.0% | **61.4%** | +1.4% |

### Confusion Matrix (Improved Model)
```
                Predicted
              GAL  QSO  STAR
Actual  GAL [  35   10    14 ]
        QSO [  13   33    11 ]
        STAR[  13    9    35 ]
```

**Key Insights:**
- GALAXY detection improved significantly (+9.3%)
- QSO slightly decreased but still good
- STAR detection maintained
- More balanced confusion matrix overall

## üéì Lessons Learned

### 1. **Data Quality > Model Complexity**
- Simple augmentation (noise) >> Complex ensembles (stacking)
- 865 real+augmented samples > 534 SMOTE samples

### 2. **Feature Engineering is Critical**
- Statistical features (skew, kurtosis) added discriminative power
- Interaction features captured class-specific patterns
- But don't over-engineer - optimal k=55, not 80

### 3. **Ensemble Sweet Spot**
- Voting with 3 SVMs: ‚úÖ Good (+2%)
- Stacking with meta-learner: ‚ùå Too complex (-1.5%)

### 4. **RobustScaler > StandardScaler**
- Astronomical data has outliers
- RobustScaler more appropriate

### 5. **Grid Search is Essential**
- Found gamma=0.08 vs expected 0.05
- Small changes matter (0.05 ‚Üí 0.08 = +1%)
